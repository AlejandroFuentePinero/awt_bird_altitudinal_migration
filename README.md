# Altitudinal Migration and Seasonal Redistribution in Rainforest Birds

Quantifying **partial altitudinal migration** in rainforest bird communities across the Australian Wet Tropics using **Bayesian hierarchical modeling**.  
This repository contains all scripts, data structures, and outputs supporting the analysis and visualisation of **seasonal abundance redistribution** across elevation and time.

## üß≠ Overview

Tropical montane ecosystems experience pronounced **seasonal ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù**: bird populations shift uphill in summer and downhill in winter.  
This project develops a **hierarchical Bayesian workflow** to detect and quantify such altitudinal migration from long-term monitoring data (2000‚Äì2016).

Core goals:
- Estimate species- and community-level patterns of seasonal redistribution.  
- Partition migration signal from detection biases and spatial sampling heterogeneity.  
- Explore system-wide consequences for biodiversity and community structure.
